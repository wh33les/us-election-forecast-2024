        <p>This project forecasts, on each day leading up to the 2024 U.S. presidential
            election, who will win. Predictions are over the two weeks leading up to the election. Predictions are made
            using <a href="data/raw_polling_data.csv">this polling data
                from
                FiveThirtyEight</a> (no longer available on their site), along with FiveThirtyEights's polling averages
            for swing states.
        </p>
        <p>My algorithm is a Holt exponential smoothing algorithm, and the baseline is random walk with drift.
        </p>
        <p>Below you'll find the final forecast (Election Day) compared to the baseline and FiveThirtyEight's
            predictions. The predictions also include who will win which swing states (listed with their abbreviations).
            The rest of the page consists of previous days' forecasts, followed by information about my methodology.
        </p>
        <p>You can view the source for my predictions as well as plots for each day in <a

        <h2>Final forecast (Tue Nov 5 2024)</h2>
        <p>See below for reflections!</p>
        <p>My forecast and the baseline assume both candidates win their "safe" states, or the non-swing states they are
            currently projected to win. The swing states are Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, North
            Carolina, and Nevada. The formatting under "Model" and "Baseline" is:</p>
        <p style="text-align: center" ;>Candidate: # of electoral votes (popular vote) swing states won</p>
        <p>FiveThirtyEight's forecast shows the candidate's % chance of winning the election. In all three models the
            projected winner is in bold.</p>

        <p>The solid lines indicate the daily polling averages, the dashed lines indicate the model's predictions of the
            polling average trajectory with the final forecast on Nov 5, and the dotted lines are similarly the
            baseline's predictions. The model and baseline training use the last 7 days of polling data for the test
            data.</p>
        <p>The MASE (mean absolute square error) scores compare the models' performance compared to the na&iuml;ve
            forecast (the projection is just the last recorded data point). A score lower than 1 indicates the model
            out-performed the na&iuml;ve forecast.</p>

        <hr>
        <div id="reflections" class="hidden">
            <p>Couple of thoughts on Election Day, before the results were known:
            <ul>
                <li>If you've been paying attention to my hyperparameters, you'll notice my \(\alpha\)s are always very
                    low.
                    If you know anything about
                    exponential smoothing, then you'll know that this means my predictions were relying more on older
                    data
                    than newer. Incidentally, I noticed my predictions seemed to lag behind FiveThirtyEight's by a few
                    days
                    and I think this is why.
                </li>
                <li>Everyone is saying this election is a toss-up, including FiveThirtyEight. Even though they gave
                    Trump a
                    higher
                    likelihood of winning in today's forecast, they are predicting Harris will win with 270 electoral
                    votes.
                    As mentioned below, I've noticed all the swing state polling has been well within the margin of
                    error,
                    so even though my predictions about the swing states have always been based on who's leading in the
                    polls, they
                    probably aren't very helpful.</li>
            </ul>
            Thanks for visiting this site and keeping up with it. I may return with a few more thoughts once the outcome
            of
            the election is known. Happy Election Day!

        <hr>
        <div id="swing" class="hidden">
            <p>As mentioned above, my method assumed each candidate would win their "safe" states, or the non-swing
                states they were favored to win on that day. Information about likelihood of winning swing states was
                gathered from FiveThirtyEight; unfortunately that data is no longer available on their site.</p>
            <p>To predict who would win which swing states I calculated each candidate's predicted percentage of the
                popular vote,
                only among those two candidates. Then I allocated that percentage of electoral votes to each candidate.
                I awarded states starting with the states the candidate was leading in by the most, according to
                FiveThirtyEight.
                After allocating, once there were not enough votes for the next state, I gave that state to the
                candidate if their remaining votes were at least half of that state's electoral votes.</p>
            <p>Although this was a very simple algorithm, the results were not likely to differ too much from the actual
                outcome. The average sample size of the polls taken was 1600, giving an estimated margin of error of
                2.5%. All of the leads in the swing states were well within this margin of error.</p>

        <hr>
        <div id="averages" class="hidden">
            <p>In computing the daily averages I did not use all of the data available. To begin with, I only used polls
                from after Joe Biden dropped out of the race and only results for Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. There
                were a few other restrictions I made in which polls got factored into my daily averages:</p>
            <p>I only used the polls among likely voters. "Likely" is subjective, and depends on the poll. Either way,
                it made no sense to use polls from all registered or
                all adults, since the outcome was only going to be determined by those who actually voted.
            </p>
            <p>To keep my popular vote predictions consistent with my swing state predictions, I only
                used national and swing state polls. I left out all polls from non-swing states.</p>
            <p>Finally, FiveThirtyEight rates all the polls with a "POLLSCORE". <a
                    href="https://abcnews.go.com/538/538s-pollster-ratings-work/story?id=105398138">You can read about
                    their methodology for determining this metric here.</a> To summarize, negative POLLSCORES are
                considered reliable polls, so I only factored in polls whose POLLSCORE was negative.</p>

            <p>For a time series with a trend (both candidates seemed to be trending up getting closer to Election Day),
                double (Holt) exponential smoothing appeared to be the most natural choice for forecasting. Recall, the
                double

            where \(s_t\) and \(b_t\) are level and slope terms, respectively, given by
            <div class="equation">
                \begin{align}
                s_{t} &= \alpha y_t + (1-\alpha) (s_{t-1} + b_{t-1}), \ s_1 = y_1 \\
                b_{t} &= \beta (s_t - s_{t-1}) + (1-\beta) b_{t-1}, \ b_1 = y_2 - y_1

            where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are hyperparameters between \(0\) and \(1\).</p>
            <p>I ran a standard grid search to tune my hyperparameters (\(\alpha\in(0.05,0.5)\),
                \(\beta\in(0.05,0.3)\)),
                optimizing the MASE on the forecast over the
                test set relative to the MASE of the na&iuml;ve forecast on the training set over an
                equivalent horizon. I used all my polling data minus the last week as training data, with five
                cross-validation splits and
                holdout sets of 7 days each. Surprisingly,
                after running the grid search the hyperparameters all turned out to be small, meaning the better
                forecasts come from taking all previous data into account!</p>
